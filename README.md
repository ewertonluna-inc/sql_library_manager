# SQL Library Manager

This project consists on a web application that'll include pages to list, add, update and delete books. It is a dynamic website using 
- JavaScript; 
- Node.js; 
- Express; 
- Pug;
- SQL ORM Sequelize. <br>
This project was incredibly useful to understand how a server works to storage data on a database when receiving data from a webpage and also when retrieving data from it to display to the user. It helped me a lot to understand not only that but also how and when to handle server errors and pages not found. <br>
